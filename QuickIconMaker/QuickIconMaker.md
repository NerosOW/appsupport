## Running from another Shortcut
You can run this from another Shortcut, just pass the name of the Shortcut running it, and it will use the name in the menus, and return the selected icon to the Shortcut calling it rather than showing the file/photos/Base64 option.

Eg Is used in Home Launcher which puts contact/shortcut/links in one Home Screen Launcher. https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1030
