# Quick Icon Maker
#### Makes an icon with font awesome.

Search by name, or choose from an image.

- Custom colours, encodings, and file types
- Shares as a file, or base 64
- Select Icon by typing the name, searching and or choosing from list.
- Easy to search on names like archive, address card, bookmark, database, bed, bicycle.
- You can run this from another Shortcut, just pass the name of the Shortcut running it, and it will use the name in the menus, and return the selected icon to the Shortcut calling it rather than showing the file/photos/Base64 option.

Eg Is used in Home Launcher which puts contact/shortcut/links in one Home Screen Launcher. https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1030
